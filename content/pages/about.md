      #### The Project


      Sentiment Scope is a new methodological exploration into using Natural
      Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and quantify disgust
      sentiment expressed towards immigrant communities online. The objective of
      this project is to develop a robust, efficient, and cheap method for
      measuring intergroup disgust intensity, which will in turn provide insight
      into grassroots intergroup conflicts.


      #### Significance


      Quantifying intergroup disgust via NLP offers a more objective and
      unbiased approach compared to traditional qualitative methods.
      Additionally, this methodology reduces costs and significantly increases
      the scale at which data can be analysed. The findings from this project
      have the potential to equip NGOs, government bodies, and other
      stakeholders with better tools to predict and manage intergroup conflicts
      effectively.


      #### Future Directions


      While the initial focus is on anti-immigrant sentiments, the methodology
      will be extended to other intergroup tensions, such as interethnic,
      interclass, and interreligious conflicts. The ultimate aim is to create a
      cost-effective conflict-mapping tool that enhances current methods,
      improving our capacity to foresee and address grassroots conflicts.
