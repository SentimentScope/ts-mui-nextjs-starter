      ## Aims:


      Over the next few months, I will be sharing my research concerning the
      development of a method to rapidly analyse anti-immigrant sentiments with
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this research is
      to develop an efficient and reliable method for quantifying intergroup
      disgust intensity online. Unlike an in-depth qualitative analysis, a
      quantitative analysis of disgust will be in less danger of falling prey to
      ideological and political biases, and, just as importantly, be less likely
      to be dismissed as biased towards a political agenda. This methods
      research will be the foundation for further study into whether such online
      disgust narratives are predictive of grassroots intergroup conflict.


      The focus of the study will be disgust narratives levied online by local
      ingroups towards outgroups of immigrants and the descendents of
      immigrants. This is due to the pressing importance of native/immigrant
      tension in our times, its international and widespread prevalence during
      the European migrant crisis and Russia/Ukraine war, and the resultant ease
      of data collection regarding intragroup narratives and intergroup conflict
      in the case of local and immigrant groups.

      If further study demonstrates a predictive relationship between this
      initial project's measurement of disgust and conflict between locals and
      immigrant groups, then work will be expanded to measuring grassroots
      disgust narratives to predict other areas of intergroup conflict, such as
      in the case of interethnic, interclass, or interreligious tensions.


      If all three projects prove successful, it will result in a cost-effective
      tool which, when used in tandem with existing methods, will help NGOs,
      government bodies, and other stakeholders to better predict and manage
      grassroots conflict.


      ## Post schedule:


      The following posts of this blog will outline my methodology, which will
      proceed after this introduction as follows:


      1.  Introduction to Sentiment Scope


      2.  Disgust, Morality, and Intergroup Relations


      3.  Quantifying Disgust


      4.  The Categorical Model of Ingroup Disgust towards Outgroups


      5.  Collocation manual selection


      6.  Limitations Necessitating the Training of an LLM


      7.  LLM Specifications and Development Plan


      8.  Targets of Study, Dataset Selection, and Data Collection


      9.  Final Considerations and Limitations


      Following these, posts will be made reviewing relevant literature on
      disgust, dehumanisation, and conflict. The Categorical Model will be
      explored in detail, with each category receiving a post examining and
      evaluating it in reference to literature. Data collection and analysis
      will then begin. Updates will be published concerning the progress of each
      study. Finally, studies will be published in full, containing data,
      results, and discussion.


      Welcome to Sentiment Scope.
